        <p>This is a portfolio of my work.</p>
        
                <h3>Street Photography</h3>
                        <p>There's nothing better than getting lost in the business of a city, and finding the beauty in the organized chaos.</p>
        
                <h3>Portraits</h3>
                        <p>My aim is to get as close of the human essence as I can be, and the best way to achieve that is getting their look and attention. Focusing on their eyes and the moment.</p>
        
                        <p>I'm not looking for a "fancy" portrait, but rather an honest one, a human portrait. Candid moments, that's what I'm looking for </p>
